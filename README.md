# Weather API SwiftUI app

This project demonstrates how to work with Weather API (https://www.weatherapi.com) using SwiftUI and Combine. 
It shows how to make API requests using WeatherService Protocol and map received JSON data using publishers.

To test how it works please download or clone the project into your local repository.
Open the project in XCode and add API key.

To add API key you need to signup at https://www.weatherapi.com, find your API key under your account, and copy it.
Look for "apiKey" string in the project and replace it with the API key you copied.
